# Iris-Data-Set-Exploration-
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between the features of three iris flower species. It includes data cleaning, statistical summaries, and various visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and pairplots.

# Iris Data Set Exploration

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the classic Iris data set. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights aimed at understanding the relationships among different features of the iris flowers.

## Project Overview

The Iris data set is one of the most well-known datasets in data science and machine learning. It includes 150 samples from three species of Iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with four features recorded for each sample:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

This project performs the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Summary statistics and distribution analysis
- Data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
- Correlation analysis and boxplots
- Class-wise comparisons
